Snakebite
=========
Snakebite is a pure python HDFS client, that uses protobuf for communicating
with the NameNode and comes in the form of a library and a command line interface.
Currently, snakebite only supports actions that only involve the Namenode.

Snakebite uses python-protobuf 2.3, since that's what is available at Spotify.

Snakebite has been tested against Cloudera CDH4.1.3 (hadoop 2.0.0)
